Welcome to the repository of my "Simple Blog" project! Here, I developed a web app that serves as a diary of small ideas, using Local Storage to save published posts. Additionally, I implemented regular expressions to create an efficient search function.

## Overview

This project is part of the CodeLandia challenge, where I sought to create a simple blog with additional features. Local Storage is used to store posts, allowing for a continuous user experience, even after updating the page.

Additionally, I created the layout for this project based on a web design challenge in Figma. [Link to all 'Codel√¢ndia' challenges](https://www.figma.com/file/Yb9IBH56g7T1hdIyZ3BMNO/Desafios---Codel%C3%A2ndia?type=design&node-id=624-2&mode=design&t=Trxmon2KQNwAqiIN-0 ).

## Technologies Used

- **JavaScript:** The main programming language for web app development.
- **SCSS:** A stylesheet language that compiles to CSS.
- **Local Storage:** A browser feature that allows local storage of data.
- **Regular Expressions:** Used to create an efficient search function.

## Functionalities

1. **Publication of Posts:**
    - Write and publish your thoughts and ideas on the blog.

2. **Local Storage:**
    - Posts are saved in Local Storage, providing data persistence between sessions.

3. **Efficient Search:**
    - Use the search function to quickly find posts based on keywords.

4. **Responsive Style:**
    - The blog design is responsive, adapting to different screen sizes.
